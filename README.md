## ***concept:***

The website aims to provide an immersive audio experience for the user to experience throughout the daily routine of a student's life. Our goal was to take the user on a journey of the student's average day that often turns tedious. The user hears everything the student would listen to around them in their day, including numerous details about the person and the environment surrounding them. The website provides a simple visual of the audio setting to place the user in a location corresponding to the image illustration present. The website takes the user through scenes from the bedroom when the student wakes up to the bathroom, classroom, dining hall, football game, snacks bar, and eventually back to the bedroom.

The audio clips mainly used original sounds recorded from the group's daily lives. It involved various effects like adjusting the amplitude, noise reduction, and adding reverb and echo when necessary to make the audio more realistic and comprehensive to the situation present. Throughout the audio sequences, each 20-25 second time-frame captures a segment of the character's day. We intended to add an interactivity aspect to the user; thus, the user can play, pause, and repeat the audio. Finally, one's academic life might also become repetitive, which is why the user discovers that the beginning is also the ending, presenting a simple yet profound twist!

## ***results:***

Experimenting with the audio using the provided audio editing program was challenging yet exciting. I have found it somewhat confusing working with Audacity, given my background in only film-editing programs. However, I was able to include previous knowledge coherently. The audio present on the website was recorded using an iPhone 11, given our initial limitations. Nevertheless, this was beneficial given the portability advantage gained. The final outcome of the website had a continuous and coherent theme, a sketch-styled layout further complimenting the message portrayed throughout the immersive journey.
